    "## Exercise 1: Why do we need pseudopotentials? (2 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "It was discussed in the lecture that plane-wave DFT codes usually employ so-called pseudopotentials (PSP) to model the interaction of electrons and nuclei. Replacing the true Coulombic interaction by a PSP is an approximation. Multiple types of PSPs exist and from a mathematical perspective little is understood about the errors introduced by PSPs. However, from a physical point of view using PSPs is reasonable as it only effects the electron density close to the nuclei, which for most phaenomena only plays a minor role. On the upside PSPs turn out to make plane-wave calculations much more feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This aspect we will investigate numerically in this exercise. Our goal will be to determine the energy of a single neon atom using the so-called LDA approximation up to an absolute error of `0.1`. We will do this by an explicit convergence study, i.e. by increasing the basis size and improving the numerics until we are sure we have found the energy to this tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our computational setup is simple: We will put a single neon atom into a cubic box of length $a$. As DFTK uses periodic boundary conditions, this atom interacts spuriously with the neighbouring cells, introducing an error to our calculation. As $a \\to \\infty$ this error disappears, thus in principle convergence with increasing $a$ should be one parameter to study. For simplicitity (as large values of $a$ lead to very costly calculations) we will ignore this aspect here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convergence parameter we will not ignore, however, is the $E_\\text{cut}$ parameter discussed in the lecture. This parameter determines the basis set size, thus the accuracy of the calculation. Again calculations get better for $E_\\text{cut} \\to \\infty$.\n",
